# Recursive-Problems-Collection
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of recursive function implementations in Python. Each function demonstrates how recursion can be used to solve classical problems in mathematics, strings, arrays, and more. This is ideal for learning recursion, preparing for coding interviews, and practicing problem-solving skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

factorial.py – Recursive calculation of factorial (standard and tail recursion).

fibonacci.py – Fibonacci sequence (standard and tail recursion).

array_operations.py – Functions for sum, max, min, reverse, subsets, permutations, etc.

string_operations.py – Reverse string, palindrome check, remove duplicates, longest common prefix.

math_problems.py – GCD, HCF, sum of first n numbers, sum of odd numbers, powers, triangular numbers.

search_sort.py – Recursive binary search, merge sorted arrays, check if array is sorted.

linked_list.py – Length of linked list, last element of linked list.

misc_problems.py – Tower of Hanoi, pattern printing, prime checks, convert decimal to binary, etc.

## Key Features

Mathematical Recursion: Factorial, Fibonacci, sum of digits, powers, triangular numbers, HCF/GCD.

Array Operations: Find min/max, sum, sum of squares, reverse, subsets, permutations, prime numbers in array.

String Operations: Reverse, check palindrome, remove duplicates, longest common prefix, character count.

Search & Sort: Recursive binary search, merge sorted arrays, check if array is sorted.

Other Classic Problems: Tower of Hanoi, pattern printing, convert decimal to binary, calculate nth power of 2.

# Notes

All functions are implemented recursively.

Tail recursion is used where applicable for better optimization.

Examples and test cases are included in the code files.
